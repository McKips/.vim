Setup for using vim

Hi, this is my personal setup for using vim. Make sure to have vim version 8.0 installed. You can check if you do
by using vim -v.

In order to use my setup,
cd into your home directory <cd ~>, and use:

git clone https://github.com/McKips/.vim.git.

Once downloaded, cd into .vim: cd .vim/
use ls and you will see a directory "pack". cd into that directory
and perform ./install.sh. If permission is denied, use: chmod +x install.sh,
to give it execution priveleges and try installing again. Once installation is complete,
you will have this setup for vim.

Thanks!
